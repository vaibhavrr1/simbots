<p>Simple bots or Simbots is a library designed to create simple chat bots using the power of python. This library utilises Intent, Entity, Relation and Context
model to create bots .</p>
<p>Its Basic functions :-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Uses machine learning to create Intents .</p></li>
<li><p>Supports multiple ways of creating entities and relations .</p></li>
<li><p>Also provides helper functions to query context stack .</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a framework to create text based chatbots .</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a framework to define test conversation of the bot and test it.</p></li>
<li><p>Support saving and loading existing conversation .</p></li>
<li><p>Support saving and loading trained Chatbot .</p></li>
<li><p>Supports Sub Conversation management and creation .</p></li>

<h1>Usage Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#usage-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This usage guide will help illuminate you about chatbots !</p>
<div class="section" id="chatbot-terminology">
<h2>Chatbot Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#chatbot-terminology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Intent</strong>: An intent is what the user intends to say . Lets say that a user types in</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I want a Burger.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you get me a diet coke ?</p></li>
<li><p>I want a pizza.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In all three cases the intent is to Order Food.</p>
<p><strong>Entity</strong>: An entity is something that adds detail to the intent . These are often keywords in the sentence.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I want a burger. -&gt; Entity : Burger</p></li>
<li><p>Can you get me a diet coke ? -&gt; Entity : diet coke</p></li>
<li><p>I want a pizza. -&gt; Entity : pizza</p></li>
</ol>
<p>entities have multiple properties :</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>“value”:the value of the entity , In the first example it is ‘Burger’.</p></li>
<li><p>“exactValue”:the exact value that occurs within the message text. In the first example it is ‘burger’.</p></li>
<li><p>“kind”:the kind of the entity eg in the first example  Food , and in the second one Drinks</p></li>
<li><p>“foundAt”:[start location , end location] -&gt; [9 15] the position where it is detected in text .</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Relation</strong>: Often entities and intents together can help one determine the meaning of a sentence but sometimes entites interact together .
A relation is established between sentences to help bring more clarity to what the user is saying. For example:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I want a cheese burger or a bean burger. -&gt; here entities are cheese burger , bean burger and there is an “or” relation between these two</p></li>
<li><p>I want a cheese burger and fries. -&gt; here entities are cheese burger , fries and there is an “and” relation between these two</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Without Context any bot would only be able to reply to the message it just received and not the messages it received in the past .
Context in the case of simbots is simply a stack of intent , entity and relations received over time. It also contains methods to query and manage the context stack.
You can query the context method to retrieve anything in the context stack and formulate complex functionality .</p>

<h2>Quick Start<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create any bot we will need to define these things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Intents</p></li>
<li><p>Entities</p></li>
<li><p>Bot Templates (Reply messages)</p></li>
<li><p>Reason</p></li>

<h2>Reply Using Name<a class="headerlink" href="#reply-using-name" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Often you will need to detect names from messages and generate a reply using that name .
There isn’t any easy way to write a regex pattern to detect names .To do this you will need a Machine learning or Deep learning based solution.
Spacy provides NER to detect person names . Of course, you can also define your own custom name detection mechanism .</p>

<h2>How To turn Faq’s into bots<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-turn-faq-s-into-bots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many sites have Frequently Asked Questions sections (faqs) on them , where the user is expected to search through the faq’s.
Sometimes it can be more useful to have a bot learn these faq’s and interact with the users . This tutorial will teach you how</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Turn Faq’s into bot response .</p></li>
<li><p>Add and Evaluate test cases to the bot .</p></li>
<li><p>How to deal with very little training examples .</p></li>
<li><p>How to use dev mode to train the bot .</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to create a bot that answers FAQ’s about Covid . We will use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">cdc.gov</a>
faq’s to get data for the bot .</p>
<p>It assumes you have <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/yake/">yake</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">beautiful soup</a> installed
and some knowledge of web scraping .</p>
<p>this one is going to be one long tutorial :) lets get started !</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-the-initial-data">
<h3>Getting the Initial Data<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-the-initial-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need some question answer pairs for our bot to start learning . If you had a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">cdc.gov</a>  you’ll find just that for Covid 19.
Now one way to get the data is to copy and paste each question and answer pairs . A better way is to scrape the question answer pairs from the site itself.
We can use requests and Beautiful soup to do just that !</p>
<p>Each Faq will be its separate intent , note however you can also combine faqs which are similar into one intent.</p>
<p>The Faq Answer will be served as is in the bot response for this tutorial.</p>
<p>while we are scraping the website can also create some test cases to ensure that all faq’s listed are answered .</p>

<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Question :  What is COVID-19?
Answer :  COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

Question :  How does the virus spread?
Answer :  COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed <span class="k">in</span> by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than <span class="m">6</span> feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
COVID-19 is spread <span class="k">in</span> three main ways:

Breathing <span class="k">in</span> air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.

<p>So far even if we do add our scraped data into our already created intents we have very few examples for them !
So our bot isn’t going to be as accurate as we would like it . How to address this issue ?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The best solution to this is of course to create a manually curated dataset of questions for each Faq. But this can be time consuming and sometimes infeasable.</p></li>
<li><p>An alternative approach is to do somekind of Data Augmentation .</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Faqs we can add keyphrases from answers and questions to artificially augment the dataset .</p>
<p>For this tutorial we will follow a three step process:-</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>create augmented samples using keyphrase extraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Manually alter the augmented samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Train the bot in dev mode to increase bot accuracy.</p></li>

 &lt;<span class="m">1</span>&gt; basicBot : COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.
 &lt;<span class="m">2</span>&gt; User : can my pet get covid ?
 &lt;<span class="m">2</span>&gt; basicBot : Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets <span class="k">for</span> more information about pets and COVID-19.

Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults.

&lt;<span class="m">6</span>&gt; basicBot : Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and <span class="nb">let</span> them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, <span class="k">do</span> not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans <span class="k">for</span> seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps <span class="k">for</span> your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals <span class="k">for</span> COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.

<span class="s2">&lt;16&gt; basicBot : Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.</span>
<span class="s2">If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.</span>

<span class="s2">&lt;17&gt; basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).</span>

<span class="s2">&lt;18&gt; basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).</span>

<span class="s2">Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.</span>
<span class="s2">You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can’t get testing at a local healthcare facility.</span>

<span class="s2">&lt;24&gt; User : I have Trouble breathing !</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;24&gt; basicBot : COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.</span>
<span class="s2">COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:</span>

<span class="s2">Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.</span>
<span class="s2">Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.</span>
<span class="s2">Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.</span>

<span class="s2">For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;25&gt; User : can i sanitize my pets ?</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;25&gt; basicBot : Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19.</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;26&gt; User : should i use hand sanitizer on my pets</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;26&gt; basicBot : Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately. If your pet ingests hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately.</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;27&gt; User : i feel sick</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;27&gt; basicBot : People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or who are fully vaccinated</span>

<span class="s2">People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms.</span>
<span class="s2">People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.</span>
<span class="s2">People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.</span>

<span class="s2">For more information, see COVID-19: When to Quarantine and What to Do If You Are Sick.</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;28&gt; User : my son feels sick</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;28&gt; basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).</span>
