Welcome to Simbots's documentation!
===================================

Simple bots or Simbots is a library designed to create simple text based chatbots using the power of python. This library utilises Intent, Entity , Relation and Context
model to create bots .It uses a multinomial NB classifier to create intent classifiers. Currently only english language is supported. More classifier models and languages to come in future releases !

Installation
============

To install simply do

.. code:: shell

    pip install simbots

Usage Guide
===========
This usage guide will help illuminate you about chatbots !

*******************
Chatbot Terminology
*******************

**Intent**: An intent is what the user intends to say . Lets say that a user types in

1) I want a Burger.
2) Can you get me a diet coke ?
3) I want a pizza.

In all three cases the intent is to Order Food.

**Entity**: An entity is something that adds detail to the intent . These are often keywords in the sentence.

1) I want a burger. -> Entity : Burger
2) Can you get me a diet coke ? -> Entity : diet coke
3) I want a pizza. -> Entity : pizza

entities have multiple properties :

a) "value":the value of the entity , In the first example it is 'Burger'.
b) "exactValue":the exact value that occurs within the message text. In the first example it is 'burger'.
c) "kind":the kind of the entity eg in the first example  Food , and in the second one Drinks
d) "foundAt":[start location , end location] -> [9 15] the position where it is detected in text .



**Relation**: Often entities and intents together can help one determine the meaning of a sentence but sometimes entites interact together .
A relation is established between sentences to help bring more clarity to what the user is saying. For example:

1) I want a cheese burger or a bean burger. -> here entities are cheese burger , bean burger and there is an "or" relation between these two
2) I want a cheese burger and fries. -> here entities are cheese burger , fries and there is an "and" relation between these two

*******************
Quick Start
*******************

In this Example we will set up a simple bot which can answer basic questions like

Who are you ?

What is your age ?

Lets first setup some intent examples

.. code:: python

   #!/usr/bin/python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   import json

   intentExamples = {
       'Greetings': [
           'Hello !',
           'Hi , How are you ?',
           'Hey !! ',
           'Namaste ',
           'Good day',
           'Good evening',
           'Good morning',
           'Good to see you',
           'Greetings',
           'Have you been well?',
           'Hello Agent',
           'Hello',
           'Hello I am looking for some help here',
           'Hey how are you doing',
           'Hey there all',
           'Hey there',
           'Hey twin',
           'Hey you',
           'Hi advisor',
           'Hi there',
           'How are things going?',
           'How are you today?',
           'How have you been?',
           'How is it going?',
           'How r u?',
           'Looking good eve',
           'take me back',
           "What's new?",
           "What's up?",
           'Who is this?',
           'You there',
           'Namaste',
           'satsriyakaal',
           'helo',
           'hiiiiiii',
           'abe oye',
           ' sup ',
           ' wassup bruh ',
           ' sup bro ',
           ' ssssup mate whats up',
       ],
       'BotName': [
           'Who are you',
           'Who are you ?',
           'What is your Name ?',
           'What is your name ',
           'what should i call you ?',
           'What should i call you',
           'How to address you ?',
           'how  to address you by name',
           'what is your name in english',
           'call you',
           'your name',
           'call you ?',
           'your name ?',
           'whom are you',
           'whom are you referred as',
       ],

       'Irrelevant': ['the weather is fine todaythe sun rises in the east'
           , 'the quick brown fox jumps over the red carpet',
                      'This is random irrelevant text',
                      'What is love , baby dont hurt me ',
                      ],
   }

Since these intents are frequently used in many bots therefore we have added them in the utils module .

.. code:: python

   from simbots.utils.builtInIntents import IntentSamples

   intentExamples = {
    'Greetings': IntentSamples.greetingSamples(),
    'BotName': IntentSamples.botNameSamples(),
    'Irrelevant': ['the weather is fine today','the sun rises in the east','the quick brown fox jumps over the red carpet',
                   'the sun rises in the east',
                   'What is love , baby dont hurt me ',
                   'this is a new dawn a new day']
    }



Now we will add some entities here . Note that we dont have any interesting entities here . We have only added entities to help the bot identify certain
intents like Greetings

.. code:: python

   entityExamples = {
    "GreetingsHelper": {
        "wsup": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[w]*[a]*[s] [u] [p] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
        "hi": [{"tag": "case-insensitive", "pattern": "\s[h] [i] \s", "type": "regex"}],
        "hello": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[h] [e] [l] [o] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
    }}

Note that you can also import some commonly used entities.

.. code:: python

   from simbots.utils.builtInEntities import EntitySamples

   entityExamples = {
    'GreetingsHelper': EntitySamples.greetingsHelper(),
    }



Now that we are done with the entities and intents lets setup the basic bot responses . Here we have created three themes (themeBasic,funky,cowboy)
which can be switched to give varied responses.

.. code:: python

   botMessages = {
       "themeBasic": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": [
                   "Hello ! What can i do for you ?",
                   "Hi there ! what can I do for you ?",
                   "Hello",
               ]
           },
           "BotName": {"basic": ["I am riko", "You can call me riko"]},
           "Irrelevant": {
               "basic": [
                   "Im sorry Im not getting you :( ",
                   "Im sorry could you please rephrase ?",
               ]
           },
       },
       "funky": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": ["Hey Yo Wassup Bro What can i do for ya ?", "Heyo what ya want ?"]
           },
           "BotName": {"basic": ["Yo Im Riko ! "]},
       },
       "cowboy": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": [
                   "Howdy partner what can i do for you greenhorn",
                   " Howdy ! Pleasure meeting ya ?",
               ]
           },
           "BotName": {
               "basic": ["Howdy Partner , Im Riko  "]
           },
       },
   }



Now lets define the bot . To do that you must always define the reason method in the bot class. Depending on the usecase you might also have to change the
'say' method.

.. code:: python

   from Bot import Bot
   class NewBot(Bot):

       def reason(self):

           # # find current dialogNumber

           currentDialogNumber = self.contextManager.context['dialogs'][-1]

           currentTopIntent = self.contextManager.findCurrentTopIntent()

           currentEntities = self.contextManager.findCurrentEntities()

           output = []

           if currentTopIntent['confidence'] < self.confidenceLimit \
                   or currentTopIntent['name'] == 'Irrelevant':
               currentTopIntent = {}

           if currentTopIntent:

               # #
               # # Rule For All
               # #
               # if currentTopIntent["name"]=="Greetings":
               # #
               # # Person is greeting
               # #

               name = currentTopIntent['name'].split('_')[0]
               reply = {'tag': '{0}.basic'.format(name), 'data': None}
               # note if you had defined the botname response as "my name is {0}" , then you can change the botname
               # response by changing the data field here as this is set in the string.


               # "message":""

               output.append(reply)
           else:

               # #
               # #
               # # Rule for irrelevant
               # #
               # #

               irrelevant = {'tag': 'Irrelevant.basic', 'data': None}

               output.append(irrelevant)

           return output

   newB = NewBot(intentExamples, entityExamples, botMessages,
                 confidenceLimit=0)

Once we have defined the bot, lets run it !

.. code:: python

   outputTheme = 'themeBasic'

   newB.run(theme = outputTheme)
