Quick Start
*******************

In this Example we will set up a simple bot which can answer basic questions like

Who are you ?
What is your age ?

Lets first setup some intent examples

.. code:: python

   #!/usr/bin/python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   import json

   intentExamples = {
       'Greetings': [
           'Hello !',
           'Hi , How are you ?',
           'Hey !! ',
           'Namaste ',
           'Good day',

Now we will add some entities here . Note that we dont have any interesting entities here . We have only added entities to help the bot identify certain
intents like Laughter and Greetings

.. code:: python

   entityExamples = {
    "GreetingsHelper": {
        "wsup": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[w]*[a]*[s] [u] [p] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
        "hi": [{"tag": "case-insensitive", "pattern": "\s[h] [i] \s", "type": "regex"}],
        "hello": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[h] [e] [l] [o] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
    },
    "LaughterHelper": {
        "haha": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s(h (a|e) ) (h )?\s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
        "happysmily": [
            {"tag": "case-insensitive", "pattern": "\s\:\)\s", "type": "regex"}
        ],
    },
    "CoolHelper": {
        "cool": [{"tag": "case-insensitive", "pattern": "\sc oo l \s", "type": "regex"}]
    },
    "ByeHelper": {
        "bye": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s(goo d)?b y e \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ]

   }

Now that we are done with the entities and intents lets setup the basic bot responses .

               "basic": [
                   "Im sorry Im not getting you :( ",
                   "Im sorry could you please rephrase ?",

           },
           "Abilities": {"basic": ["Yo I can get ya somethin to eat "]},
       },
       "cowboy": {

               "basic": ["You up for some food ? cause i can help you with that "]
           },
       },
   }



Now lets define the bot . To do that you must always define the reason method in the bot class.

.. code:: python

   from Bot import Bot
   class NewBot(Bot):

       def reason(self):

           # # find current dialogNumber

           currentDialogNumber = self.contextManager.context['dialogs'][-1]

           currentTopIntent = self.contextManager.findCurrentTopIntent()

           currentEntities = self.contextManager.findCurrentEntities()

           output = []

           if currentTopIntent['confidence'] < self.confidenceLimit \
                   or currentTopIntent['name'] == 'Irrelevant':
               currentTopIntent = {}

           if currentTopIntent:

               # #
               # # Rule For All
               # #
               # if currentTopIntent["name"]=="Greetings":
               # #
               # # Person is greeting
               # #

               name = currentTopIntent['name'].split('_')[0]
               reply = {'tag': '{0}.basic'.format(name), 'data': None}

               # "message":""

               output.append(reply)
           else:

               # #
               # #
               # # Rule for irrelevant
               # #
               # #

               irrelevant = {'tag': 'Irrelevant.basic', 'data': None}

               output.append(irrelevant)

           return output

   newB = NewBot(intentExamples, entityExamples, botMessages,
                 confidenceLimit=0)

Once we have defined the bot, lets run it !

.. code:: python

   outputTheme = 'basic'

   print('Type @@ to exit bot ,@i to get intents ,@c to get context')
   while True:

       inputMessage = input('User : ')

       if inputMessage == '@@':
           break
       elif inputMessage == '@i':
           print('Bot Intents: ')
           print(json.dumps(newB.getBotConfidence(), indent=2))
       elif inputMessage == '@c':
           print('Bot Context: ')
           print(json.dumps(newB.getBotContext(), indent=2))
       else:
           inputMessage = ' {0} '.format(inputMessage)
           output = newB.getBotOutput(inputMessage, outputTheme)
           print('{0}Bot : {1}'.format(outputTheme, output))
