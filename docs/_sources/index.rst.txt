Welcome to Simbots documentation!
===================================

Simple bots or Simbots is a library designed to create simple chat bots using the power of python. This library utilises Intent, Entity, Relation and Context
model to create bots .

Its Basic functions :-

1) Uses machine learning to create Intents .
2) Supports multiple ways of creating entities and relations .
3) Also provides helper functions to query context stack .
4) Provides a framework to create text based chatbots .
5) Provides a framework to define test conversation of the bot and test it.
6) Support saving and loading existing conversation .
7) Support saving and loading trained Chatbot .
8) Supports Sub Conversation management and creation .


Installation
============

To install simply do

.. code:: shell

    pip install simbots

Usage Guide
===========

This usage guide will help illuminate you about chatbots !

*******************
Chatbot Terminology
*******************

Intents
********

An **Intent** is what the user intends to say . Lets say that a user types in

1) I want a Burger.
2) Can you get me a diet coke ?
3) I want a pizza.

In all three cases the intent is to Order Food.

Entities
********
An **Entity** is something that adds detail to the intent . These are often keywords in the sentence.

1) I want a **burger**.  , Entity : Burger
2) Can you get me a **diet coke** ? , Entity : diet coke
3) I want a pizza. -> Entity : pizza

entities have multiple properties :

a) "value":the value of the entity , In the first example it is 'Burger'.
b) "exactValue":the exact value that occurs within the message text. In the first example it is 'burger'.
c) "kind":the kind of the entity eg in the first example  Food , and in the second one Drinks
d) "foundAt":[start location , end location] -> [9 15] the position where it is detected in text .

Relations
*********

Often entities and intents together can help one determine the meaning of a sentence but sometimes entities interact together .
A **Relation** is established between sentences to help bring more clarity to what the user is saying. For example:

1) I want a cheese burger **or** a bean burger. -> here entities are cheese burger , bean burger and there is an "or" relation between these two
2) I want a cheese burger **and** fries. -> here entities are cheese burger , fries and there is an "and" relation between these two

Context
********

Without **Context** any bot would only be able to reply to the message it just received and not the messages it received in the past .
Context in the case of simbots is simply a stack of intent , entity and relations received over time. It also contains methods to query and manage the context stack.
You can query the context method to retrieve anything in the context stack and formulate complex functionality .

DialogNumber
************

Each user and chatbot message pair is treated as a dialog , the bot in dev mode will always show the **dialog number** .

How to Create Bots
==================

*******************
Quick Start
*******************

To create any bot we will need to define these things:

1) Intents
2) Entities
3) Bot Templates (Reply messages)
4) Reason

Note you can find the complete code for this bot `here <https://github.com/vaibhavrr1/simbots/blob/main/sampleBots/QuickStartBot.ipynb>`_ .

What this bot will do
**********************

In this Example we will set up a simple bot which can answer basic questions like

Who are you ?

What is your age ?

Intents
*******

Lets first setup some intent examples

.. code:: python

   #!/usr/bin/python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   import json

   intentExamples = {
       'Greetings': [
           'Hello !',
           'Hi , How are you ?',
           'Hey !! ',
           'Namaste ',
           'Good day',
           'Good evening',
           'Good morning',
           'Good to see you',
           'Greetings',
           'Have you been well?',
           'Hello Agent',
           'Hello',
           'Hello I am looking for some help here',
           'Hey how are you doing',
           'Hey there all',
           'Hey there',
           'Hey twin',
           'Hey you',
           'Hi advisor',
           'Hi there',
           'How are things going?',
           'How are you today?',
           'How have you been?',
           'How is it going?',
           'How r u?',
           'Looking good eve',
           'take me back',
           "What's new?",
           "What's up?",
           'Who is this?',
           'You there',
           'Namaste',
           'satsriyakaal',
           'helo',
           'hiiiiiii',
           'abe oye',
           ' sup ',
           ' wassup bruh ',
           ' sup bro ',
           ' ssssup mate whats up',
       ],
       'BotName': [
           'Who are you',
           'Who are you ?',
           'What is your Name ?',
           'What is your name ',
           'what should i call you ?',
           'What should i call you',
           'How to address you ?',
           'how  to address you by name',
           'what is your name in english',
           'call you',
           'your name',
           'call you ?',
           'your name ?',
           'whom are you',
           'whom are you referred as',
       ],

       'Irrelevant': ['the weather is fine todaythe sun rises in the east'
           , 'the quick brown fox jumps over the red carpet',
                      'This is random irrelevant text',
                      'What is love , baby dont hurt me ',
                      ],
   }

Since these intents are frequently used in many bots therefore we have added them in the utils module .

.. code:: python

   from simbots.utils.builtInIntents import IntentSamples

   intentExamples = {
    'Greetings': IntentSamples.greetingSamples(),
    'BotName': IntentSamples.botNameSamples(),
    'Irrelevant': ['the weather is fine today','the sun rises in the east','the quick brown fox jumps over the red carpet',
                   'the sun rises in the east',
                   'What is love , baby dont hurt me ',
                   'this is a new dawn a new day']
    }


Entities
********

Now we will add some entities here . Note that we dont have any interesting entities here . We have only added entities to help the bot identify certain
intents like Greetings

.. code:: python

   entityExamples = {
    "GreetingsHelper": {
        "wsup": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[w]*[a]*[s] [u] [p] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
        "hi": [{"tag": "case-insensitive", "pattern": "\s[h] [i] \s", "type": "regex"}],
        "hello": [
            {
                "tag": "case-insensitive",
                "pattern": "\s[h] [e] [l] [o] \s",
                "type": "regex",
            }
        ],
    }}

Note that you can also import some commonly used entities.

.. code:: python

   from simbots.utils.builtInEntities import EntitySamples

   entityExamples = {
    'GreetingsHelper': EntitySamples.greetingsHelper(),
    }

Responses
*********

Now that we are done with the entities and intents lets setup the basic bot responses . Here we have created three themes (themeBasic,funky,cowboy)
which can be switched to give varied responses.

.. code:: python

   botMessages = {
       "themeBasic": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": [
                   "Hello ! What can i do for you ?",
                   "Hi there ! what can I do for you ?",
                   "Hello",
               ]
           },
           "BotName": {"basic": ["I am riko", "You can call me riko"]},
           "Irrelevant": {
               "basic": [
                   "Im sorry Im not getting you :( ",
                   "Im sorry could you please rephrase ?",
               ]
           },
       },
       "funky": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": ["Hey Yo Wassup Bro What can i do for ya ?", "Heyo what ya want ?"]
           },
           "BotName": {"basic": ["Yo Im Riko ! "]},
       },
       "cowboy": {
           "Greetings": {
               "basic": [
                   "Howdy partner what can i do for you greenhorn",
                   " Howdy ! Pleasure meeting ya ?",
               ]
           },
           "BotName": {
               "basic": ["Howdy Partner , Im Riko  "]
           },
       },
   }

Bot
*****************


Since for this case no complicated reasoning is involved , we can directly use the Bot class to run our bot.
By Default , it will determine the intent with the highest probability  from the input message and output the
corresponding basic template message.

.. code:: python

   from simbots.Bot import Bot

   newB = Bot(intentExamples, entityExamples, botMessages,
              confidenceLimit=0)

Once we have defined the bot, lets run it !

.. code:: python

   outputTheme = 'themeBasic'

   newB.run(theme = outputTheme)

The output should look like

.. code:: shell

   Type in @@ to exit bot
   @i to get intents
   @c to get context
   @e to get entities
   @t to add a test case
   @etc to evaluate a test case
   @eatc to evaluate all test cases
   @ti to add intent
   <1> User : hi
   <1> themeBasicBot : Hello
   <2> User : who are you ?
   <2> themeBasicBot : I am riko
   <3> User : hey riko !
   <3> themeBasicBot : Hi there ! what can I do for you ?


Note that the bot can only answer two questions , because thats all we tought it to do !

If you simply want the bots output as text .

.. code:: python

   output = newB.getBotOutput("hi who are you ?",outputTheme ="themeBasic")
   print(output)

*********************
A Bot for simple conversation
*********************

Now here's the bot with a number of intents and entities added . In case you want to see the jupyter notebook use `here <https://github.com/vaibhavrr1/simbots/blob/main/sampleBots/BotForSimpleConversation.ipynb>`_ .

What this bot will do
**********************

This will be able to answer to basic questions like

1) Hello
2) what is your name ?
3) Do you have any relatives
4) What is your age ?
5) Where were you born ?
6) What can you do ?
7) Tell me a joke

Sample Conversations
**********************

Some conversations with this bot :

.. code:: shell

   Type in @@ to exit bot
   @i to get intents
   @c to get context
   @e to get entities
   @t to add a test case
   @etc to evaluate a test case
   @eatc to evaluate all test cases
   @ti to add intent
   <1> User : hi
   <1> themeBasicBot : Hello ! What can i do for you ?
   <2> User : who are you?
   <2> themeBasicBot : You can call me riko
   <3> User : hey riko !
   <3> themeBasicBot : Hello ! What can i do for you ?
   <4> User : what can you do ?
   <4> themeBasicBot : I am learning to make basic conversation !
    ... and i can tell you a couple of jokes :)
   <5> User : sure tell me one
   <5> themeBasicBot : Sure here is one I burned 2000 calories today<>I left my food in the oven for too long.
   <6> User : hahah
   <6> themeBasicBot : And they say I dont have a sense of humor :)
   <7> User : thats amazing !
   <7> themeBasicBot : So nice of you to say that !
   <8> User : do you have a sister perhaps ?
   <8> themeBasicBot : Umm no i dont really have any relatives :)
   <9> User : oh that's too bad
   <9> themeBasicBot : I know right
   <10> User : thanks for talking to me !
   <10> themeBasicBot : So nice of you to say that !
   <11> User :  bye then
   <11> themeBasicBot : Bubye !
   <12> User : @@


*********************
Reply Using Name
*********************

Often you will need to detect names from messages and generate a reply using that name .
There isn't any easy way to write a regex pattern to detect names .To do this you will need a Machine learning or Deep learning based solution.
Spacy provides NER ( Named Entity Recognition )to detect person names . Of course, you can also define your own custom name detection mechanism .

You can find the complete code for the bot `here <https://github.com/vaibhavrr1/simbots/blob/main/sampleBots/ReplyUsingNameBot.ipynb>`_.

Entities
**********************

To start off you need to define an entity extractor and an entity substituter .


.. code:: python

   import spacy

   # Load English tokenizer, tagger, parser and NER
   nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

   def extractor(messageText,dialogNumber):
       doc = nlp(messageText)
       extractedNamesFromText = []
       for entity in doc.ents:
           if entity.label_ =='PERSON':
               extractedNamesFromText.append(

               {
                   "value" : entity.text,
                   "exactValue" : entity.text,
                   "kind":'PERSON',
                   "dialogNumber": dialogNumber,
                   "foundAt":[entity.start_char, entity.end_char]
               }
               )
       return extractedNamesFromText


   def substituter(messageText):
       doc = nlp(messageText)
       textLabel = [(entity.text, entity.label_) for entity in doc.ents if entity.label_=='PERSON']
       for text, label in textLabel:
           messageText = messageText.replace(text, label)

       return messageText


Next we need to create an entity for detecting names lets call it NameHelper

.. code:: json

   'NameHelper':{
           'personName':[{'type' : 'function',
                          'extractor': extractor,
                          'substituter':substituter,
                          'tag':'case-insensitive'
           }]



       }

Intents
**********************

Also we will need to define Intents for name detection lets call it PersonName

.. code:: json

    {"PersonName": ["My name is Vaibhav","I am Vaibhav Arora .","You can call me Rahul ." ,
                    "I am Simon  . ","I am Riko .","You can call me Shiva . "]}


Bot Messages
**********************

We need to write what the bot will output.

.. code:: json

    {
    'basic': {
		'Greetings': {
			'basic': ['Hello ! What can i do for you ?',
				'Hi there ! what can I do for you ?', 'Hello'
			],
            "nameKnown":[
                "Hi {0} ! Its a pleasure to meet you !",
                "Hey {0} its a pleasure talking to you !"
            ]
		},
        "PersonName": {
			'basic': ["Its a pleasure to meet you {0} ."],
			"nameNotFound": ["Im sorry i couldn't get your name could you please write it in title case like -> Riko  "]


		}
    }

Reason (Bot Logic)
**********************

Since we are doing some operations based on intents and entities we need to modify the bot reason method to accomodate this.
We will make a new bot class that inherits from our original Bot class.


.. code:: python

   # this goes in the reason method of the bot class

   name = currentTopIntent['name']

   if name == 'Greetings' and ("sessionVariables" in  self.contextManager.context.keys()):

       personName =  self.contextManager.context["sessionVariables"]["PERSON"]

       reply = {'tag': '{0}.nameKnown'.format(name), 'data': personName}


   elif name =='PersonName' and len(currentEntities) >0:

       currentEntities =[ent for ent in currentEntities if ent["kind"] =='PERSON' and ent["exactValue"].lower() != 'riko']

       self.contextManager.context["sessionVariables"] = {

           "PERSON" :currentEntities[0]["exactValue"]

       }
       self.contextManager.updateContextTree()


       reply = {'tag': '{0}.basic'.format(name), 'data': currentEntities[0]["exactValue"]}

   elif name =='PersonName':

       reply = {'tag': '{0}.nameNotFound'.format(name), 'data': None}
   else:
        reply = {'tag': '{0}.basic'.format(name), 'data': None}

How To turn Faq's into bots
************************

Many sites have Frequently Asked Questions sections (faqs) on them , where the user is expected to search through the faq's.
Sometimes it can be more useful to have a bot learn these faq's and interact with the users . This tutorial will teach you how

1) Turn Faq's into bot response .
2) Add and Evaluate test cases to the bot .
3) How to deal with very little training examples .
4) How to use dev mode to train the bot .

We are going to create a bot that answers FAQ's about Covid . We will use `cdc.gov <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html>`_
faq's to get data for the bot .

It assumes you have `yake <https://pypi.org/project/yake/>`_ and `beautiful soup <https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`_ installed
and some knowledge of web scraping .

the complete code for this tutorial can be found `here <https://github.com/vaibhavrr1/simbots/blob/main/sampleBots/FaqsBot.ipynb>`_ .

this one is going to be one long tutorial :) lets get started !

Getting the Initial Data
*************************

We need some question answer pairs for our bot to start learning . If you had a look at the `cdc.gov <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html>`_  you'll find just that for Covid 19.
Now one way to get the data is to copy and paste each question and answer pairs . A better way is to scrape the question answer pairs from the site itself.
We can use requests and Beautiful soup to do just that !

Each Faq will be its separate intent , note however you can also combine faqs which are similar into one intent.

The Faq Answer will be served as is in the bot response for this tutorial.

while we are scraping the website can also create some test cases to ensure that all faq's listed are answered .

.. code:: python

   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   import requests

   page = requests.get("https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html")
   soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')

   intentExamplesScraped = {}
   botMessagesScraped = {"basic":{},"test":{}}

   testCase = {"faqListed":{
     "conversation": [
     ],
     "description": "Contains all Faq's and expected answers on the cdc website"
   }}


   def removeSpecialCharactersWithSpaces(text):
       return ''.join(e for e in text if e.isalnum())


   for el in soup.find_all(class_="card card-accordion"):

       ques = el.find(class_="card-title btn btn-link")
       ans  = el.find(class_="card-body")

       print("Question : " , ques.text)
       print("Answer : ",  ans.text)
       intentName = removeSpecialCharactersWithSpaces(ques.text)
       intentExamplesScraped[intentName] = [ques.text.replace("?"," ?")]*10
       botMessagesScraped["basic"][intentName] = {"basic" :[]}
       botMessagesScraped["basic"][intentName]["basic"].append(ans.text)
       botMessagesScraped["basic"][intentName] = {"basic" :[]}
       botMessagesScraped["basic"][intentName]["basic"].append(ans.text)
       testCase["faqListed"]["conversation"].append([ques.text.replace("?"," ?"),ans.text])
       print()


Output

.. code:: shell

   Question :  What is COVID-19?
   Answer :  COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

   Question :  How does the virus spread?
   Answer :  COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
   COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:

   Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
   Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
   Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.

   For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.

Building some simple conversation into the bot
*********************

Before we add the scraped data into our bot we need to make the bot answer simple questions like

1) who are you ?
2) What can you  do ?

etc

lets build in the intents , entities and responses for that

.. code:: python

   from simbots.Bot import Bot
   from simbots.utils.builtInIntents import IntentSamples
   from simbots.utils.builtInEntities import EntitySamples



   intentExamples= {

      'Greetings': IntentSamples.greetingSamples(),

       'BotName': IntentSamples.botNameSamples(),

       'Relatives': IntentSamples.relativeSamples(),

       'Age': IntentSamples.ageSamples(),

       'BirthPlace': IntentSamples.birthPlaceSamples(),

       'Abilities': IntentSamples.abilitiesSamples(),

       "Bye":IntentSamples.byeSamples(),

       'Irrelevant': ['the weather is fine today','the sun rises in the east','the quick brown fox jumps over the red carpet',
                  'the sun rises in the east',
                  'What is love , baby dont hurt me ',
                  'this is a new dawn a new day'],

   }



   botMessages = {
     "basic": {
         'Age': {
               'basic': ['I am two years old ', 'I am two']
           },
           'BotName': {
               'basic': ['I am CovidInfoBot', 'You can call me CovidInfoBot']
           },
           'Abilities': {
               'basic': ['I can tell you about Covid 19 or corona virus disease .']
           },
           'BirthPlace': {
               'basic': ['I am from India' , 'India', 'I am an Indian']
           },
           "Greetings":{
                 "basic" : ["Hi ","Hello "]
           },
           "Bye":{
              "basic":["It was nice talking to you ! Take care, keep safe and wear a mask ."]
           },
           "Relatives":{
               "basic":["No , I dont have any relatives ."]

           },
          'Irrelevant': {
               'basic': ['Im sorry Im not getting you :( ',
                   'Im sorry could you please rephrase ?'
               ]
           },

     }

   }


   entityExamples = {
       'GreetingsHelper': EntitySamples.greetingsHelper(),
       'ByeHelper': EntitySamples.byeHelper(),
       'Covid19':{
           'covid19':[{"type" : "regex","tag" :'case-insensitive',"pattern":"(corona virus disease)|(corona virus)|(covid-19)|(covid 19)|(covid19)|(coronavirus disease)|(covid disease)|(covid)"}]
       },
       'SarsCov2':{
           'sarscov2':[
               {
                   "type":"regex",
                   "tag":'case-insensitive',
                   "pattern":"(SARS-CoV-2)|(SarsCov2)(Sars)"

               }

           ]
       }

   }


How to add more examples to intents
***********************************

So far even if we do add our scraped data into our already created intents we have very few examples for them !
So our bot isn't going to be as accurate as we would like it . How to address this issue ?

   1) The best solution to this is of course to create a manually curated dataset of questions for each Faq. But this can be time consuming and sometimes infeasable.

   2)  An alternative approach is to do somekind of Data Augmentation .

For Faqs we can add keyphrases from answers and questions to artificially augment the dataset .

For this tutorial we will follow a three step process:-

   1) create augmented samples using keyphrase extraction.

   2) Manually alter the augmented samples.

   3) Train the bot in dev mode to increase bot accuracy.

lets use Yake to create augmented data samples


.. code:: python

   def createExampleIntentsThroughYake(text,max_ngram_size = 4,minLength=0,probThreshold=0.85):
       language = "en"
       deduplication_threshold = 0.8
       numOfKeywords = 50
       keyWordExtractor = yake.KeywordExtractor(lan=language, n=max_ngram_size, dedupLim=deduplication_threshold, top=numOfKeywords, features=None)
       returnedKeywords =[ ]
       text = ".".join([removeSpecialCharactersWithOutSpaces(el) for el in text.split(".")])
       keywords = keyWordExtractor.extract_keywords(text)

       for keyWord in keywords:
           if (len(keyWord[0].split() ) >=minLength) and keyWord[1]>probThreshold:
               returnedKeywords.append(keyWord[0])
       return returnedKeywords

   def removeSpecialCharactersWithOutSpaces(text):
       return ''.join(e  if e.isalnum() or e==" " else " "  for e in text )


   intent = "CanbatsinUnitedStatesgetthevirusthatcausesCOVID19andcantheyspreaditbacktopeople"
   createExampleIntentsThroughYake(botMessagesScraped["basic"][intent]["basic"][0] ,probThreshold=0.3,minLength=2)

.. code:: shell

   ['present in bats',
    'illness or death',
    'coronavirus would make',
    'bats in the United',
    'affected by COVID',
    'bats resulting',
    'declining in the United',
    'species of bats sick',
    'important part',
    'part of natural']

looks like we are on to some thing ! some of the sample like 'present in bats' could be useful.


Augment the dataset
********************

lets now add the augmented dataset to the bot

.. code:: python

   for intent in intentExamplesScraped.keys():

      # extract keywords from answers
      intentExamplesScraped[intent].extend(createExampleSentencesThroughYake(botMessagesScraped["basic"][intent]["basic"][0] ,probThreshold=0.3,minLength=2))
      # extract keywords from questions themselves

      intentExamplesScraped[intent].extend(createExampleSentencesThroughYake(intentExamplesScraped[intent][0] ,probThreshold=0))

   for intent in intentExamplesScraped.keys():
       intentExamples[intent] = intentExamplesScraped[intent]

   for message in botMessagesScraped["basic"].keys():
       botMessages["basic"][message] = botMessagesScraped["basic"][message]

Also now lets make some manual changes. Note ive used comments to indicate the changes ive made during a quick glance throught the bot.
This will be much quicker than manually adding all the examples yourself.

.. code:: python

Building and running the bot
*****************************

Now lets build the bot ! Dont forget to add the test cases.

.. code:: python

   from simbots.Bot import Bot
   from simbots.utils.builtInIntents import IntentSamples
   from simbots.utils.builtInEntities import EntitySamples
   import json


   newB = Bot(intentExamples, entityExamples, botMessages,testCases=testCase,
                 confidenceLimit=0)

   outputTheme = 'basic'

   newB.run(theme = outputTheme)

now lets test it out !

.. code:: shell

  Type in @@ to exit bot
   @i to get intents
   @c to get context
   @e to get entities
   @t to add a test case
   @etc to evaluate a test case
   @eatc to evaluate all test cases
   @ti to add intent
   <1> User : tell me about covid ?
   <1> basicBot : COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.
   <2> User : can my pet get covid ?
   <2> basicBot : Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19.
   <3> User : can i get covid from animals ?
   <3> basicBot : Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19.


Training in Dev mode
*********************

The bot is doing good ! however we need to train it further to be awesome !

we can use @ti to do that . I noticed that the bot was getting confused about a question about pets

.. code:: shell

   <4> User : is my pet at risk of getting covid ?
   <4> basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).
   For more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.

   <6> User : is there a risk of my pet getting covid ?
   <6> basicBot : Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
   If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.

Finally , it seems to be getting this question !

Checking your test Cases
************************

Anytime you train the bot for a new intent , it is possible that it messed up an old one as the bot learns to assign probabilities to each intent.
We can check if the bot fails any test cases by using @eatc. We see that so far the bot has not failed our test examples .

   <7> basicBot : People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or who are fully vaccinated

   People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms.
   People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.
   People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.

   <10> User : is there covid in my cat's fur ?
   <10> basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).
   For more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.

   <14> basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).

   <16> User : i think i am sick with covid
   <16> basicBot : Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
   If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.

   <18> basicBot : Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).
   For more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.

   <20> User : i am positive i am sick
   <20> basicBot : If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area.
   For more information, see COVID-19 Contact Tracing.
   Watch for or monitor your symptoms of COVID-19. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care.
   <21> User : i am positive i am sick with covid
   <21> basicBot : People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or who are fully vaccinated

   People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms.
   People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.
   People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.

   For more information, see COVID-19: When to Quarantine and What to Do If You Are Sick.
   <22> User : Is vaccination available for covid ?
   <22> basicBot :
   Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.
   You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can’t get testing at a local healthcare facility.
   For more information, see At-Home Testing.

   <23> User : when should i seek emergency medical care ?
   <23> basicBot : Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately

   Trouble breathing
   Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
   New confusion
   Inability to wake or stay awake
   Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone

   *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
   <24> User : I have Trouble breathing !
   <24> basicBot : COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
   COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:

   Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
   Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
   Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.

   For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.
   <25> User : can i sanitize my pets ?
   <25> basicBot : Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19.
   <26> User : should i use hand sanitizer on my pets
   <26> basicBot : Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately. If your pet ingests hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately.

The more you do this the better the bot becomes !

Saving and loading the bot
**************************

If we need our bot to remember what we trained it for we need to save it !
we can do this by

.. code:: python

   newB.saveBot("botSession1.p")

consequently any new bot can be loaded by

.. code:: python

   newB.loadBot("botSession1.p")

*******************
Take Order Bot V1
*******************

Whew ! we have made it so far ! lets now start making a bot to capture orders from customers . This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of Sub Conversations and Context Management.
We will start by building a bot to capture simple customer orders and then modify the bot for better conversational experience in Take Order Bot V2 !

lets get started !
